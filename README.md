# Model Building
* I  split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 25%., I also Stadarized the Data . 
* I tried two different models .
   * Random Forest â€“ Again, with the sparsity associated with the data, I thought that this would be a good fit.
   * Knn.

# Model Performance
* Random Forest : score = 96%

* KNN : score = 95%
